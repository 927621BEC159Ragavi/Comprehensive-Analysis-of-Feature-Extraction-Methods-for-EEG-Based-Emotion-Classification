# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Feature-Extraction-Methods-for-EEG-Based-Emotion-Classification
Emotion recognition from EEG signals is crucial in HCI, mental health, and affective computing. This study enhances EEG-based emotion classification using DWT to extract delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma features. Machine learning models (CNN, RNN, SVM, LDA, Decision Trees) achieve 96% accuracy.
